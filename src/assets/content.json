Born and raised in rural Arizona, Shannon never really felt ‘at home’ and repressed many aspects of herself. Since being in Canada surrounded by more like-minded folks, she has learned to embrace her queer, neuro-divergent, Jewish identity.  Given that she spent 24 years living in a conservative environment she still has many blind spots and is actively working to unlearn most of the things she was raised to believe. She holds a master’s degree in drama therapy and enjoys rock climbing, reading, acro yoga, and complicated board games. She is most proud of her self-supported bikepacking trip through the Canadian Rockies without dying."

As a Jewish woman who had studied drama at McGill, and who spoke French with an instantly recognisable English accent (still do), my sense of difference and imposture was definitely heightened. In parallel, I joined Montreal Playback Theatre as actor an in 2002. Am still seeking novelty, thrills and connections."
